	<p>
		<span>I used to rule the world</span>
		<br>
		<span>Seas would rise when I gave the word</span>
		<br>
		<span>Now in the morning I sleep alone</span>
		<br>
		<span>Sweep the streets I used to own</span>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<span>I used to roll the dice</span>
		<br>
		<span>Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes</span>
		<br>
		<span>Listened as the crowd would sing</span>
		<br>
		<span>Now the old king is dead long live the king</span>
		<br>
		<span>One minute I held the key</span>
		<br>
		<span>Next the walls were closed on me</span>
		<br>
		<span>And I discovered that my castles stand</span>
		<br>
		<span>Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</span>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<span>I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing</span>
		<br>
		<span>Roman cavalry choirs are singing</span>
		<br>
		<span>Be my mirror, my sword and shield</span>
		<br>
		<span>My missionaries in a foreign field</span>
		<br>
		<span>For some reason I can't explain</span>
		<br>
		<span>Once you'd gone there was never</span>
		<br>
		<span>Never an honest word</span>
		<br>
		<span>And that was when I ruled the world</span>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<span>It was a wicked and wild wind</span>
		<br>
		<span>Blew down the doors to let me in</span>
		<br>
		<span>Shattered windows and the sound of drums</span>
		<br>
		<span>People couldn't believe what I'd become</span>
		<br>
		<span>Revolutionaries wait</span>
		<br>
		<span>For my head on a silver plate</span>
		<br>
		<span>Just a puppet on a lonely string</span>
		<br>
		<span>Oh who would ever want to be king?</span>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<span>I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing</span>
		<br>
		<span>Roman cavalry choirs are singing</span>
		<br>
		<span>Be my mirror, my sword and shield</span>
		<br>
		<span>My missionaries in a foreign field</span>
		<br>
		<span>For some reason I can't explain</span>
		<br>
		<span>I know St Peter won't call my name</span>
		<br>
		<span>Never an honest word</span>
		<br>
		<span>But that was when I ruled the world</span>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="chorus">
		<span>Oh oh oh oh ohh oh</span>
		<br>
		<span>Oh oh oh oh ohh oh</span>
		<br>
		<span>Oh oh oh oh ohh oh</span>
		<br>
		<span>Oh oh oh oh ohh oh</span>
		<br>
		<span>Oh oh oh oh ohh oh</span>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<span>Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing</span>
		<br>
		<span>Roman cavalry choirs are singing</span>
		<br>
		<span>Be my mirror, my sword and shield</span>
		<br>
		<span>My missionaries in a foreign field</span>
		<br>
		<span>For some reason I can't explain</span>
		<br>
		<span>I know St Peter won't call my name</span>
		<br>
		<span>Never an honest word</span>
		<br>
		<span>But that was when I ruled the world</span>
