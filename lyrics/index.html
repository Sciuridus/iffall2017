			<span>I used to rule the world</span>
			<br>
			<span>Seas would rise when I gave the word</span>
			<br>
			<span>Now in the morning I sleep alone</span>
			<br>
			<span>Sweep the streets I used to own</span>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<span>I used to roll the dice</span>
			<br>
			<span>Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes</span>
			<br>
			<span>Listened as the crowd would sing</span>
			<br>
			<span>Now the old king is dead long live the king</span>
			<br>
			<span>One minute I held the key</span>
			<br>
			<span>Next the walls were closed on me</span>
			<br>
			<span>And I discovered that my castles stand</span>
			<br>
			<span>Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</span>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="hear">
			<span>I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing</span>
			<br>
			<span>Roman cavalry choirs are singing</span>
			<br>
			<span>Be my mirror, my sword and shield</span>
			<br>
			<span>My missionaries in a foreign field</span>
			<br>
			<span>For some reason I can't explain</span>
			<br>
			<span>Once you'd gone there was never</span>
			<br>
			<span>Never an honest word</span>
			<br>
			<span>And that was when I ruled the world</span>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<span>It was a wicked and wild wind</span>
			<br>
			<span>Blew down the doors to let me in</span>
			<br>
			<span>Shattered windows and the sound of drums</span>
			<br>
			<span>People couldn't believe what I'd become</span>
			<br>
			<span>Revolutionaries wait</span>
			<br>
			<span>For my head on a silver plate</span>
			<br>
			<span>Just a puppet on a lonely string</span>
			<br>
			<span>Oh who would ever want to be king?</span>
		</p>
		<br>

			<b>I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing</b>
