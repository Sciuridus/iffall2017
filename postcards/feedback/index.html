	<h1> Suggestions for Eddie's Design <br></h1>

	<h2> Aesthetics <br></h2>
	<div>
		Game of throne typeface is an interesting choice to emphasize the show. It can be hard to read given it’s a stylized display font, so I would use something more legible.
		<br>	<br>
	The transparency change and faded background works nice individually and as a whole.<br> At smaller scale (i.e. larger image and less background) photoshop marks become visible, so I suggest cleaning them up a bit.
		<br>	<br>
	The leading for text is consistent in horizontal structures, but both minimum type-size and text-height are different at mobile size, <br>so I would aim to get them to have the same structure.
		<br>	<br>	<br>
	</div>
	
	<h2> Structure <br></h2>
	
	<div>
		Image over text. Text floating on concentrated background gives good contrast versus image, so I think it works.
	<br>	<br>
	Background color and blended background of image are Background, while the Portraits and the text feel like the foreground, which is appropriate. <br>The use of transparency is solid for the overall design.
	<br>	<br>
	There aren’t a lot of focal points in the portraits themselves, so shrinking the images or cropping them wouldn’t hurt them too much.
	<br>	<br> <br>

	</div>

	<h2> Technical Challenge <br></h2>
	
	<div>
		There would be at least three break points to accommodate the image-size change and text wraps/scale shifts.  	
		<br>	<br>
		It doesn’t seem like Eddie’ design have instances of text colliding with image.
	<br>	<br>
	Image edges are reduced by the use of transparency, and it should work just fine.
	<br>	<br>
	As I’ve mentioned before, I like the typeface at large, but it can get tricky at smaller point-sizes. <br>I would recommend changing it to a more legible typeface, and I feel some serif typeface would fit well with GOT thematics. 
	</div>
